The VS2019 and VS2017 Azure pipelines Windows-based images are now in the [virtual-environments](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments) repository. The Windows Container image is still being managed in the azure-pipelines-image-generation repository for now. For future contributions to the VS2017 or VS2019 image or for issues regarding any of the images, please use the virtual-environments repository instead. You can still view the commit history of those images from when they used to live in the azure-pipelines-image-generation repository.
